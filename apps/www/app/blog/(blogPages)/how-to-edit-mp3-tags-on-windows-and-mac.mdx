If your music library is full of tracks named **Track 01**, **Unknown Artist**, or missing album artwork, you are not alone. Most audio files contain metadata called **ID3 tags**, but over time those tags can become messy, duplicated, or completely wrong.

This guide explains:

- what MP3 tags are
- why they matter
- how to edit them safely on Windows and macOS using Audexis

> Tip: Audexis runs locally, does not upload files, and supports batch editing with undo and redo.

## What are MP3 and ID3 tags?

MP3 tags, also called **ID3 tags**, are bits of information stored inside an audio file.

Common fields include:

- Title
- Artist
- Album
- Album Artist
- Track Number
- Disc Number
- Genre
- Year or Date
- Comment
- Embedded album artwork

Music players read these fields to show song information.

When tags are missing or inconsistent, you might see:

- Unknown Artist
- albums split into multiple groups
- songs out of order
- missing or incorrect album covers

Fixing tags brings structure back to your library.

## Why edit MP3 tags?

Clean metadata helps you:

- organize music collections
- sort albums correctly
- prepare files for DJ software or music players
- avoid duplicate tracks
- automatically rename files based on tags
- keep artwork consistent

Good tags save time later.

### 1. Download and install Audexis

https://www.audexis.app

Audexis is code signed, notarized, and supports automatic updates.

---

### 2. Import your music files

1. Open Audexis
2. Drag files or folders into the window
3. Or use the Import button

Your tracks will appear in the table.

You can customize columns in **Settings → Columns** if you want to see more fields.

---

### 3. Edit tags for a single song

1. Select a file in the table
2. Use the tag panel on the left
3. Update fields like Title, Artist, Album, Genre, and more
4. Click Save or use the keyboard shortcut

If you make a mistake, press Undo. Changes are fully reversible.

---

### 4. Edit tags for multiple songs at once

You can batch edit fields.

1. Select multiple files
2. Change a value in the tag panel
3. Save

Only the fields you change are updated. Everything else stays untouched.

This is useful for:

- setting the same Album or Album Artist
- fixing Genre in multiple files
- applying the same year across a release

---

### 5. Add or replace album artwork

To change artwork:

1. Select one or more files
2. Open the Artwork section
3. Drag an image file or choose one from disk
4. Save

Tip: Square images work best. 500x500 or higher is usually ideal.

---

### 6. Rename files from tags

Once tags are clean, filenames can follow them.

Use pattern based renaming, such as:

```

{artist} - {title}
{track} {title}
{album}/{track} {title}

```

Audexis shows a preview before renaming so you can confirm everything looks right.

Undo is available if needed.
