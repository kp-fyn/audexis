Sometimes you discover tracks on YouTube or SoundCloud that are not available on streaming platforms. Maybe it is an unreleased demo, a remix, or a live recording you really like.

You might want that song inside Apple Music, organized with the rest of your library, with proper artwork and tags.

This guide shows you how to:

- prepare custom tracks
- edit metadata so everything looks right
- import the songs into Apple Music


- sync them to your devices

> Important reminder: Only use audio files you have permission to download and store. Respect the artist and copyright laws in your country.

## Step 1: Get the audio file legally

Before anything else, make sure you have the right to use the music. Examples of legal sources include:

- files you created yourself
- downloads provided directly by the artist
- paid releases from online stores
- tracks released under licenses that allow downloading

Avoid using tools that rip or copy streams without permission. That can lead to account issues, legal problems, or takedowns.

Once you have an MP3 or M4A file, you are ready to clean it.

## Step 2: Open the file in Audexis

1. Open Audexis
2. Drag your song file into the app
3. Select the track

You will see editable fields on the left.

---

## Step 3: Fill in the metadata

Apple Music relies heavily on metadata for sorting and grouping music.

Make sure to fill:

- **Title**
- **Artist**
- **Album**
- **Album Artist** (useful for compilations)
- **Genre**
- **Year**
- **Track Number**

Keep everything consistent. Apple Music reads exactly what you put here.

---

## Step 4: Add proper album artwork

Unreleased or custom tracks often have no artwork.

To add artwork:

1. Open the Artwork section
2. Drag an image or select one from your computer
3. Save your changes

Tips:

- Square images look best
- Aim for at least 1000x1000 when possible
- Avoid tiny or pixelated images

Artwork is embedded directly into the file so it travels with it.

---

## Step 5: Import into Apple Music

### On macOS

1. Open Apple Music
2. Go to **File → Import**
3. Select your edited file

The track will appear in your library with the metadata you created.

If you organize music in folders, you can also drag the file directly into a playlist.

---

## Step 6: Sync to your other devices (optional)

If you use **Sync Library**:

1. Open Apple Music settings
2. Enable Sync Library
3. Wait for Apple to upload your track

After that, your custom song shows up on:

- iPhone
- iPad
- other Macs

with the same metadata and artwork.

If something looks wrong, remove the song, fix it again in Audexis, then import once more.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The wrong artwork appears

Remove the song from Apple Music completely, then reimport after fixing artwork in Audexis.

### My file split into a different album

Check:

- Album
- Album Artist
- Year

They must match across all songs in the album.

### The track does not sync

Make sure Sync Library is enabled and allow time for upload.

## Enjoy custom music, but do it responsibly

With Audexis and Apple Music together, you can organize:

- unreleased songs you created
- artist dropbox downloads
- demos
- personal recordings
- edits and remixes you have permission to keep

Everything stays clean, organized, and consistent.
