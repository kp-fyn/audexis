A new update is here! Audexis v0.9.3 brings better FLAC support, a new changelog popup, and some quality improvements.

---

## FLAC Support (With Smarter Detection)

Audexis now understands **FLAC metadata**.

- Reads and writes Vorbis Comments
- Handles cover images correctly (multiple images supported as well)
- Detects FLAC files more reliably
- Works alongside with other formats well


---

##  Changelog Popup After Updates

You’ll now see a clean popup after installing a new version:

- What changed  
- What’s new  
- What was fixed  
- What was removed

---

##  Removed “Manage Albums” (For Now)

The **Manage Albums** button has been removed.

It didn’t really do anything meaningful 
I would bring it back later when it:

- actually organizes albums,
- autofills metadata intelligently,
- and integrates smoothly into workflows.


---

##  Small Quality Improvements

- General cleanup under the hood  
- Minor UI polish  
- Stability improvements while writing metadata
