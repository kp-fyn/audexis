# Table and Columns

Learn how to control which columns are visible and how to reorder them.

## Reordering columns in the grid

- Drag any column header left/right to change its position.
- Width can be adjusted by dragging the resizer between headers.

Changes persist to your user config.

## Settings → Columns

Use the Columns panel to:

- Toggle columns on/off
- Drag to reorder
- Quickly filter columns with the search input

The list includes built-in fields like Path and Release (tag_format) plus tag-based fields.
